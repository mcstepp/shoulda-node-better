Node Notes:

Who is uses Node in production on the back-end?
=> Walmart, Netflix, Uber

What is Node?
=> Javascript run-time that uses the V8 engine
=> Uses event-driven, non-blocking language I/O

What is the V8 engine?
=> Open-source Javascript engine written in C++
=> Takes javascript code and compiles it to machine code
=> Works inside of Nodejs, and used in Chrome browser

What is I/O?
=> Input/Output
=> Application does all the time
=> Communcation from node application to the internet of things
=> Database read/write
=> Changing files on your file system
=> Making HTTP request on separate web server, like Google API for fetching a map for the user's current location. 

What is non-blocking I/O?
=> While one user is doing all sorts of things, it doesn't prevent another user from doing things. 



1. Node => Javascript
	a. global => window
	b. document => process

2. Blocking Vs. Non-blocking
	a. Each request takes three seconds
	b. non-blocking => running at the same time

```
/*
* blocking.js
* Takes over six seconds to complete
*
*/
var getUserSync = require('./getUserSync');

var user1 = getUserSync('123');
// waiting on user1 =>long request I/O
console.log('user1', user1);
// printing user1 => short, non-I/O

var user2 = getUserSync('321');
console.log('user2', user2);

var sum = 1 + 2;
console.log('The sum is ' + sum);

```

```
/*
* non-blocking.js
* Takes just over 3 seconds to complete
*
*/
var getUser = require('./getUser');

getUser('123', function (user1) {
console.log('user1', user1);
});

getUser('321', function (user2) {
console.log('user2', user2);
});

var sum = 1 + 2;
console.log('The sum is ' + sum);

```
